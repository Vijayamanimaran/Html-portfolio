<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m a Computer Science engineering student with a strong interest in full-stack development and software engineering. I enjoy turning ideas into functional, user-friendly applications and constantly pushing myself to learn new technologies.

My learning journey includes Java, JavaScript, Python, and modern frameworks like React, Express, and MERN stack, along with a growing focus on backend development, databases, and cloud deployment. I’ve actively explored multiple full-stack paths to understand how scalable, real-world applications are built end to end.

Beyond coding, I enjoy problem-solving, logical reasoning, and algorithmic thinking, which helps me approach challenges with clarity and structure. I’m continuously working on improving my skills through online courses, hands-on projects, and self-learning.

I’m currently focused on building strong fundamentals, developing meaningful projects, and preparing myself for opportunities in software development and full-stack engineering. I believe in learning by doing and staying adaptable in a fast-evolving tech world..</p>
